UsefulUiDebug Bannerlord mod

This mod was born out of frustration of trying to understand how TW built their UI.
The mod adds info to the UiDebugMode window that makes it much easier to find where different widgets come from and how different screens are built.

Also adds hotkey Shift+F1 to open/close the UI debug window.
